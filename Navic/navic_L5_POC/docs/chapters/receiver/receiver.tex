The baseband samples optained from the receiver frontend is given to the receiver module.

\section{Receiver operation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The samples from the frontend contains the doppler frequency and code phase and carrier phase. 
	\item The doppler frequency and codephase is removed by the receiver module and obtain the navigation data transmitted.
	\item From the navigation data we find the position of satellites in the orbit.
	\item From the position of satellites we find the position of receiver on the earth.
	\item The detailed explanation of receiver is given in
